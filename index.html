  <h2>Introduction</h2>
  <div id="intro">
  <p> I've used the following approach to talk to patients who are hesistant about vaccines with success.<br> I tailor the strategy to the individual's concerns. Click on the blue boxes and hopefully this helps you too!</p>
  </div>
  <h2> Step 1: Ask About Patient's Concerns </h2>
<div class="dropdown">
<button onclick=dropdown('d1') class="dropbutton"> Provider: What are your concerns regarding the vaccine?</button>
  <div id="d1" class="dropcontent">
    <p>Reflect and validate the patient's concerns. I ask them to remember that I am salaried with no kickbacks and I took an oath to give them the best advice I can. I tell them I do not own any stock in vaccine companies, but I really wish that I had bought some. I tell them I am not a politician and my only interest is tell them the best truth I can find.</p>
  </div>
  </div>
  <h2> Step 2: Address Patient's Concerns</h2>
    <div class="dropdown">
      <button onclick=dropdown('d2') class="dropbutton"> Pt: "I dont trust the vaccine."</button>
 <div id="d2" class="dropcontent">
    <p>I agree. I approach all vaccines with great skepticism. There were over 60 vaccines in the trials and NACI has now narrowed recommendations to just two. I would not recommend the one that failed trials in australia, I would not push the Sputnik vaccine on you, and I agree with the scientist's reluctance towards Astrazeneca because of the very unlikely event of blood clots. I have reviewed the studies of Pfize and Moderna, which I am happy to go over with you.</p>

  <div class="dropdown">
<button onclick=dropdown('d3') class="dropbutton"> 
  Pt: "I'm young and not at risk of dying."
    </button>
    <div id="d3" class="dropcontent">
      <p>I agree. Your risk of death is low. But let me share my perspective with you, if you dont mind. Firstly, this is the only infectious disease that kills your age group in any significant numbers. Its not a lot, but it is still the most. Secondly, I am seeing chronic issues such as memory loss, lung disease, and semi permanent foul tastes and smells. Many young patients are still disabled if not dead or in the hospital.</p>
    </div>
  </div>
  <div class="dropdown">
<button onclick=dropdown('d4') class="dropbutton"> Pt: "The government can't make me get it and I dont trust them."</button>
    <div id="d4" class="dropcontent"> <p>I agree. It is your body and your choice. I think you have every right to decide. I want you to know that I'm on your side and I really think you should consider it. This is a nasty virus and I've lost many patients to it this year, and none to the vaccine. For the record you have lots of good reasons to not trust the government, but medical ethics have come a long way and I would trust the government a lot more than the virus. </p>
    </div>
  </div>
<div class="dropdown">
<button onclick=dropdown('d5') class="dropbutton">Pt: "Its not a vaccine and it will change my DNA"</button>
  <div id="d5" class="dropcontent"> <p> I have a bit more fun with this one, I say I keep hoping for an extra arm or set of eyes because of all the paperwork I do. </p><p>
Then I get serious and explain what an MRNA vaccine is and that it dissolves right away. I explain that it has to be superfrozen because it is so inherently unstable once its in the body it cant stick around. I try to soothe their uncertainty as much as I can.</p>
  </div>
  <h2>Step 3: Listen even more</h2>
 <div class="dropdown">
   <button onclick=dropdown('d6') class="dropbutton"> Remove uncertainty</button>
    <div id="d6" class="dropcontent"> <p>Listen even more. Answer their questions. Removing uncertainty soothes anxiety. Keep it light and approach them with humility. Read medical history, it will make you more empathetic. Read about the Guatemala syphilis experiments and the Tuskegee study if you are really flummoxed as to why your minority patients dont trust it right away.</p>

<!-- Ive had a lot of success. I follow the same approach and tailor it.

Step 1: I ask, " What are your concerns?"

Step 2: I reflect and validate their concerns. I ask them to remember that I am salaried with no kickbacks and I took an oath to give them the best advice I can. I tell them I do not own any stock in vaccine companies, but I really wish that I had bought some. I tell them I am not a politician and my only interest is tell them the best truth I can find.

"I dont trust the vaccine."

Response: I agree. I approach all vaccines with great skepticism. There were over 60 vaccines in the trials and I only recommend three. I would not recommend the one that failed trials in australia, I would not push the Sputnik vaccine on you, and I frankly dont even like Astrazeneca because of the variants (sorry Europeans). I have reviewed all 200 pages of Pfizer, Moderna, and JJ and I am happy to go over them with you.

"I'm young and not at risk of dying."

Response: I agree. Your risk of death is low. But let me share my perspective with you, if you dont mind. Firstly, this is the only infectious disease that kills your age group in any significant numbers. Its not a lot, but it is still the most. Secondly, I am seeing chronic issues such as memory loss, lung disease, and semi permanent foul tastes and smells. Many young patients are still disabled if not dead or in the hospital.

"The government cant make me get it and i dont trust them.

Response: I agree. It is your body and your choice. I think you have every right to decide. I want you to know that Im on your side, but if you are paying me for advice I really think you should consider it. This is a nasty virus and Ive lost many patients to it this year, and none to the vaccine.

And for the record you have lots of good reasons not to trust the government, but a company like Pfizer didnt even take government funding, and the alternative is a virus that came out of god knows where in China.

"Its not a vaccine and it will change my DNA"

I have a bit more fun with these because they cant really be reflectdd. I say vaccine means " of the cow" and its a pretty loose definition, and actually the first vaccine was probably " of the horse" so actually there has never really been a vaccine. I say I keep hoping for an extra arm or set of eyes because of all the paperwork I do.

Then I get serious and explain what an Mrna vaccine is and that it dissolves right away. I explain that it has to be superfrozen because it is so inherently unstable once its in the body it cant stick around. I try to just soothe their uncertainty as much and I can.

You get the idea.

Step 3: Listen even more. Answer their questions. Removing uncertainty soothes anxiety. Keep it light and approach them with humility. Read medical history it will make you more empathetic. Read about the Guatemala syphilis experiments and the tuskegee study if you are really flummoxed as to why your minority patients dont trust it right away.

Step 4: If theyre convinced, have your nurse set up an appointment immediately. If theyre not, ask them to keep an open mind and make an appointment prior to flu season to reapproach them.
